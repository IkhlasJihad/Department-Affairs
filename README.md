# Department-Affairs

Interface for department secertary to use.
It provides access to some functionality including:
  * View Department: select it from a combo box, click "Details" to display its main details and statistics.
  * Manage Department: start new window includes 3 tabs(Students, Instructors, Courses), 
    each includes "Add" button to add new record, and a clickable table so when a record is double-clicked, a sub-window will open for the edit/update tasks on that record's editable* fields.
    Courses table is exceptionally "Editable table", so editing takes place inside the editable cell when it's double-clicked, and is submitted when "Enter" is hit, or ignored with hitting "Esc".
